On my lock screen — the cover screen that shows the time before I unlock it entering the main dashboard with apps — I added a clock widget.\n\nI wanted to show both my local time in London and another clock for Hong Kong. However, for some reason, the second clock always shows a location called **“CUP”** by default.\n\nIn the Clock app (under “World Clock”), I’ve already added both London and Hong Kong, but the widget on the lock screen doesn’t let me change “CUP” to Hong Kong or any other city. It’s stuck there.\n\nDoes anyone know how to fix this or what “CUP” even refers to? Thanks in advance!",

Below are pros/implied cons (if let's say s23 ultra pro says return button that means it's a pro for s23 ultra and the iPhone lacks it so it's a con for iPhone) with an overall conclusion at the end.\n\nSamsung s23  ultra\n- Return button\n- Less stutter/lag\n- Number row by default when typing (can download swiftkey on iphone)\n- Zoom on camera\n- Better backspace deletion (can download swiftkey on iphone)\n- Better sensitivity /accuracy of icons\n- Notifications \n\nApple iPhone 17\n- Camera (quality and convenience of camera button on the side)\n- Size and weight\n- Swipe left and right for faster window switch\n- Face time\n- “Smoother”/better ui (more intuitive)\n- Face ID unlock \n- Stickers \n- Blue messages\n\nThese are the major differences and I didn't bother listing minor ones.\n\nOverall, I can't say iphone 17 is better even though it came out a couple years after s23 ultra. There are pros and cons for each phone but with the current ios26 causing frame drop issues for me I'm leaning more towards s23 ultra and I might even think about getting an s26 ultra. I'm not very much into customization either and if I were, it'd not make much sense for me to get an iPhone. Don't get me wrong. I like how most ppl I know use iphone and I like the phone, but if I were to make as unbiased of an opinion btwn the two I would have to go with s23 ultra. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

New Phone they migrated everything to was an iPhone 17.\n\nOpen up the orange and white **mii fitness** app. At the bottom right click **Profile**. Scroll down a little bit and until you see a purple icon on the left that says **App settings**. At the very top you can change your **Region** to China. Scan your watch. if that doesn't work factory reset your watch and turn off the old phone and power up your new phone, then start pairing again.\n\nHowever your watch  can't pair until you sign into your xiaomi account in the Mii Fitness app\n\nThe person also didn't remember their xiaomi account password and login credentials that their kids made. Those kids didn't write down passwords in their google \"keep\" app or stored anywhere digitally on the phone. So I had to create a new one with their existing email. However their Gmail account has a dot in the username. [firstname.lastname@gmail.com](mailto:firstname.lastname@gmail.com)\n\n**Dots anywhere in the email username are invalid** when creating a Xiaomi Account. Says email is invalid in red text. Crazy!\n\nCool so lets do it another way. Xiaomi also lets you create an account with a Phone number. I couldn't create an account with their North American phone number probably due to it being the Chinese version of the watch and it wanted a Chinese phone number!???!! The shit is this?!\n\n\n\nStupid China version caused so much headaches.",

      "selftext": "Markets wrapped up another busy session with tech once again in full control. The S&amp;P and Nasdaq both closed higher, led by strength in mega-caps and semiconductors, while investors continued to position ahead of a heavy earnings week.\n\n**Apple (AAPL)** hit a **$4 trillion market cap** milestone today, a number that still feels surreal even in 2025. Strong iPhone 17 sales and optimism ahead of earnings kept the stock steady, but traders were more curious about what comes next. The spotlight turned to **Corning**, Apple’s key glass supplier, whose improved durability tech could ironically slow upgrade cycles down the road. With options markets pricing in only modest movement for Apple’s earnings, sentiment seems cautiously confident rather than euphoric.\n\n**Applied Materials (AMAT)** was another standout. Analysts cheered continued revenue growth across memory, logic, and AI-related demand, pushing shares higher. The semiconductor equipment maker continues to ride the same wave of optimism that lifted Qualcomm yesterday, with investors betting that the AI build-out is still in its early innings.\n\nElsewhere, **Amazon (AMZN)** stayed in focus ahead of its upcoming report. Traders debated whether AWS’s dominance can hold up as clients diversify across multiple cloud providers. Meanwhile, **American Tower (AMT)** struggled to gain traction, weighed down by currency headwinds and rate sensitivity despite solid operational results.\n\nOverall, it was another day defined by tech leadership and a market that’s leaning optimistic but still grounded. The big players are carrying the weight while everyone else waits for the next round of earnings to set the tone.\n\nThat’s a wrap for today’s session. See you at Opening Bell where Apple’s numbers, Amazon’s outlook, and the ever-growing AI story will take center stage.",

Going to try and be as brief as possible:\n\n  \nSept 18 - Signed up through Costco ATT (called the number on the Costco Site) for the new iPhone 17 trade in deal. They were supposed to port in my old number, but instead gave me a new number to temporarily use, while they sorted out the porting issue. \n\n  \nSept 21 - they weren't able to port my number from US Mobile (which apparently uses the same network and the salesman knew this but still tried to sell me the plan). Spoke to management on the third party company side and they apologized, I told them to cancel my service, cancel the number, etc. I went back to using my original number with a different provider. Manager confirmed everything is cancelled and that I wouldn't be charged for anything. Got a UPS return slip, returned the device the same day. Got my refund for the taxes/fees shortly after. \n\nAll of a sudden, a few days ago (Oct 23), I get an email saying \"Your AT&amp;T Wireless Bill is Ready to View\", and it's a bill for $160. **Not only did I not think that I had an account, but when I just called them, apparently I had a number too**. Even though they see 3 days of service, they're still charging me $160. They said the AT&amp;T Costco team isn't AT&amp;T, any discounts or fixes they offer don't stand, etc. So had I not received this email, I wouldn't have even known that they didn't cancel my number/service. \n\n  \nThis is where things get scary - I spoke to a rep and they said we'll clear all the charges, our bad, but transferred me to the loyalty department to get the number cancelled. That department said you'll still have to pay something, which is around $30 for the 3 days of usage. I told them I was told I won't have to pay anything, but when she transferred me to a supervisor (a crazy lady by the name of Christina), she quite literally yelled at me, when asked to speak to her supervisor, she had a weird power trip and started yelling and saying \"you know what, we're not going to give you any discount (even $35 was what the last rep just told me I'd pay), and that's final. **I'm reverting all charges so they all stand and you have to pay everything, I'm going to note down that you will have to pay it all**\", and hung up on me.\n\n  \nI called back and they said they can waive the Oct to Nov service for non-usage, but nothing they can do about earlier charges, even though they see I only have 3 days of usage. They brought it from $160 to $80 something. When I told them about the previous call, he said he sees a note from Christina saying \"the $30 price was incorrect, $160 still stands\". Can they just lie like that? \n\n  \nWhat can I do? I don't want to have to pay $80 for 3 days of service where, to the best of my knowledge, an AT&amp;T rep told me I wouldn't have to pay. ",

Quando fui ativar, a pessoa que solicitou o código, não apenas tinha conseguido acesso ao meu telegram, como configurado a autenticação de dois fatores. Consegui retirar o acesso dele da minha conta e precisei esperar 7 dias para poder trocar a autenticação. Não houve mais tentativas. Fiquei desesperada, até na minha operadora liguei, porque fiquei pensando como ele teve acesso a esse código, e ele tentou apenas o telegram, nenhuma rede social mais.

      "selftext": "So I’m sure I’m not the only who seen the rumors regarding the enhanced satellite features for the next generation of Pro model iPhones such as the 18 Pro and Pro Max.\n\nAnd I’m sure I’m not the only one who felt a little left out after one bought the latest 17 Pro after reading said rumors?\n\nBut I will both speculate and drop some facts I found regarding if the current models and past ones will get this enhanced satellite connectivity, if it’s natively supported or if there is a workaround.\n\nSo to give a better idea on what the IPhones will require for this enhanced connectivity is a feature called:\n\n5G NTN\n\n5G NTN or ”Non Terrestrial Networks” is a feature set that includes added hardware for timing and Doppler shift compensation to handle fast moving low orbit satellites, and the hardware required to not only lock on reliably, but also seamlessly.\n\nQualcomm has released multiple videos explaining what and how 5G NTN works and their capabilities, here is one such example:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wGV5PA15kFg?si=MFu_CV4EF1VFw6-8\n\n5G NTN would allow a user to be able to seamlessly switch between a TN(Terrestrial Network) and an NTN(Non terrestrial Network) without loss of data or live connection such as a video call.\n\nA NTN network is designed and meant to provide coverage with the use of aerial assets or space based assets such as UAVs, Aircraft’s, Balloons and satellites.\n\nThe current min - max speeds for an NTN connection one could realistically expect under normal conditions is around 1-10 mbit/s download and about 0.5 - 2 mbit/s upload(for satellite based NTN).\n\nDue note that this is speculation on my part as the sources I found have varying opinions so this is my realistic expectation.\n\nBut now, onto the IPhones at hand.\n\nTo be Brief:\n\nthe current IPhone 17 PRO models and the regular iPhone 17 support 5G NTN due to them being equipped with the Snapdragon X80 modem, which is fully certified according to the criteria set by 3GPP to handle the full feature set of 5G NTN and 5G NB-NTN connectivity, this is supported by Qualcomms own documentation.\n\nThis means in short the current IPhone 17 and 17 Pro models have the hardware necessary for enhanced satellite connectivity.\n\nThis also means the IPhone Air does not support enhanced satellite connectivity, unless proven otherwise. Currently there is no available documentation that confirms the C1X modems has NTN support…\n\nSo the current limitation with the regular models and Pro models is software.\n\nThis also means that the next generation of IPhone 18 pros will most likely carry the same features, although it’s possible with added hardware to further enhance the connectivity such as better antennas.\n\n5G NTN is not supported on older models based on the documentation I could find online, so users with an IPhone 16 Pro and older unfortunately lack this hardware.\n\nHowever, we’ve seen that NTN might not be necessary, as proven by SpaceX and their current generation of 4G enabled Direct to Cell Starlink constellation. However some users have reported a lag or disconnect when switching between ground based and space based connectivity.\n\nSo to wrap this up:\n\n5G NTN is fully supported on the Snapdragon X80 Cellular modem, found in the IPhone 17 and IPhone 17  Pro models(Hardware vise)\n\niPhone Air lacks the necessary hardware for NTN.\n\nExpected min-max speed is 1-10 Mbit/s down, 0.5-2 Mbit/s up.\n\nCurrently no software integration on current iOS versions, support added at a later time hopefully.\n\nSpaceX 2nd Generation Direct to Cell(5G), AST Spacemobile and Skylo are NTN enabled.\n\n5G NTN uses the n252 - n256 bands, no extra hardware required, dedicated bands for satellite connectivity(MSS).\n\nThat’s it for me, enjoy I gueS",

      "selftext": "I recently bought an iPhone 17 Pro and wanted to better understand how photography works on it—especially when it comes to formats like RAW, ProRAW, and HEIC. Alongside the native Camera app, I tested three of the most popular third-party apps: **Halide**, **Lightroom**, and **Indigo Project**. Here’s a summary of my findings. Feel free to correct me if I’ve misunderstood anything.\n\n# Photo Formats on iPhone\n\nThere are essentially three types of photo formats available:\n\n**1. Processed (HEIC / JPEG)**\n\nThis is the default format, and it takes full advantage of Apple’s computational photography. Images are typically captured at up to 48 megapixels on the iPhone 17 Pro. These files go through Apple’s pipeline—noise reduction, dynamic range optimization, and other adjustments, the details of which are proprietary. This format serves as the baseline for comparing the others.\n\n**2. ProRAW**\n\nThis format can be seen as a hybrid: it’s not fully unprocessed, but it offers significantly more editing latitude than HEIC or JPEG. You can adjust white balance, exposure, and other parameters. However, it still benefits from some of Apple’s processing, such as image fusion and noise reduction. ProRAW is available in both 12MP and 48MP.\n\n**3. Unprocessed RAW**\n\nThis is the purest form of sensor data, with no processing at all. It’s not available through the native Camera app but can be accessed via third-party apps like Halide. This format theoretically gives you full control—but at a cost.\n\n# Third-Party Apps: What Do They Actually Add?\n\n# Halide\n\nHalide supports all three formats: processed, ProRAW, and unprocessed RAW. Compared to Apple’s Camera app, it provides more control, such as manual adjustment of white balance, focus area, shutter speed, and ISO.\n\nThat said, there are some limitations.\n\nI didn’t dive deeply into the HEIC/JPEG options, since I’m not particularly interested in those. I assume the results are similar to Apple’s, with the welcome addition of choosing between 12MP and 48MP outputs.\n\nProRAW capture works much like it does in the native app—same resolutions, similar image quality. The added benefit with Halide is manual control over white balance and focus. However, the moment you take manual control over exposure settings (shutter speed and ISO), the output drops to 12MP. That’s disappointing, and for me, almost a deal breaker.\n\nAs for unprocessed RAW, it may seem ideal in theory—no image fusion, no artificial HDR, no noise reduction—but you’re once again limited to 12MP. And that’s where you realize just how dependent mobile sensors are on computational processing. Without it, and at just 12MP, the results aren’t particularly impressive.\n\n# Lightroom\n\nLightroom offers its own RAW capture system, separate from both Apple’s and Halide’s. I started running some tests, but quickly stopped when I saw that RAW files were also limited to 12MP. That made it irrelevant for my use case.\n\n# Indigo Project\n\nThis app has been marketed as a major advancement in smartphone computational photography. But again, RAW files are captured at only 12MP, meaning all processing and edits are constrained by that resolution. For me, that makes it a non-starter as well.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nIn the end, switching to a third-party app for photography on the iPhone has fairly limited benefits.\n\nIf you want a cleaner, less processed alternative to ProRAW, you’re stuck with 12MP files. That alone significantly reduces the appeal. The only real advantage to using apps like Halide is being able to shoot ProRAW while gaining access to extra tools—manual focus, white balance control, exposure settings, histograms, etc.\n\nBut considering that Halide is subscription-based, it raises the question of whether the additional features are worth the cost—especially when the core image quality remains so closely tied to Apple’s processing.",

But iPhone seems like the better bang for buck phone.\n\nI am not into any mobile gaming, so primarily the phone would be of general use and of course a bit of photography and videography here and there.\n\nKind of torn between the two. Any suggestions would be appreciated.\n\nAlso to any pixel users, is a pixel good enough to last 3 years without the battery going for a toss ?",

      "selftext": "Hello everyone, I don't know what exactly I did wrong, it's been working fine for the last year, I must have changed some setting that is now causing the pairing file to expire after restarting my iPhone, and I also have sidedtore on my iPad where everything works perfectly. I've been trying around a bit over the last few days and I must have done something that caused this, but unfortunately I can't remember what it could have been, I've tried a few things but unfortunately it didn't work. I did think about resetting the phone completely and restoring everything from the backup, but I'm worried that I'll probably cause the error (settings) to reappear, then I thought about just resetting the settings and content, which would mean that I would have to add my passwords everywhere, including my bank cards, and whether I really still have all the passwords in my head is another question. After rebooting, when I refresh the apps, it shows me an error message saying I'm not connected to StosVPN, etc. Only when I generate a new pairing file and replace it with the old one (which worked two minutes before I restarted the phone) does it work again.  Perhaps someone has had the same problem and knows the solution?! I would be very happy to receive suggestions and ideas!\n\nP.s Of course, I can always generate a new pairing file, but it's just annoying to have to make sure the phone doesn't turn off every time. While everything works fine on the iPad, I've unfortunately configured something stupid on the phone.\n\nThank you in advance for any helpful answer\n\niPhone 13 mini Ios 17.3.1",

I used the swipe gesture navigation on my previous android phone (OP7) and hence the navigation part was familiar including the swipe back on my iPhone 17.

      "selftext": "I’m going to a Tame Impala concert tonight. Legit bought the new iPhone for this concert (I was gonna buy it eventually but rushed for the concert). I’ve always struggled with taking good videos at concerts with my 14 pro max. What settings should I have on? \n\nAfter some digging, im doing:\n\n4K @ 30fps (heard lower fps is better in low light, but also storage)\nHDR ON \nEnhanced Stabilization ON\nAuto FPS OFF\nLock Camera ON\nLock White Balance ON\n\nBiggest question is lock camera and white balance. I’m worried if I turn on lock camera it’ll be lower quality when I zoom in, and I just don’t know what lock white balance really is. \n\nAnother question I had, what’s the max zoom I should use? I thought 17 pro max had 8x optical zoom but apparently it’s 5x and then 8x optical-like quality? Should I not go past 5x to have the highest quality possible? Do I lower exposure and should I AE/AF lock? Is 30fps enough if I’m gonna be jumping around a lot?\n\nThank you, sorry I’m being so extra about this but I’m already depressed that the concert is gonna be over and it hasn’t even started yet so imma need to relive it later lol.\n\n\n",

      "selftext": "TL;DR: I get bad eye strain from some phone screens (like recent iPhones &amp; Galaxy S7), but my Poco F3 is fine. I want the OPPO Find X9 Pro, but I'm scared of its PWM. The Vivo X300 Pro seems safer, but I like it less. Does the TÜV Flicker-Free cert actually mean a screen is safe for sensitive users?\n\n​Hey everyone,\n\n​I'm trying to figure out if the \"TÜV Flicker-Free\" certification I see on some Chinese phone specs actually means anything. Is the display truly flicker-free (like 100% DC dimming), or does it just mean the PWM modulation depth is low enough to pass a test?\n\n​I'm sensitive to PWM flicker, and my experience has been all over the place:\n\n​GOOD: Poco F3. I've used this for years with zero issues. Even though it has a 240-480 Hz PWM rate, I assume it uses DC dimming or has a very comfortable modulation depth that saves me.\n\n​SO SO: Recent iPhones (15 Pro/16/16 plus/17 pro). I tried these, even with 17 pro \"PWM dimming reduction\" option on. All of them gave me slight to moderate eye strain and headaches, and slight disorientation after just a few minutes. I had to return each one.\n\n​HORRIBLE: Samsung Galaxy S7. This was my phone before the Poco, and it was a nightmare. The symptoms were much more noticible. Back then, I honestly thought everyone felt this way!\n\n​So here's my dilemma: I really want to buy the new OPPO Find X9 Pro. But based on my research on Reddit, I'm afraid it might have aggressive PWM with a high modulation depth, especially at higher brightness levels (like some previous Oppo models).\n\n​My other option is the Vivo X300 Pro, which seems to have one of the best \"PWM-friendly\" screens available. The problem is, I like the Oppo better in almost every other way.\n\n​This brings me back to my main question: Can I trust a \"TÜV Flicker-Free\" certification if the Oppo has one? Or is it just marketing that doesn't guarantee a comfortable experience for someone like me?\n\n​Thanks for any insights.",

I was convinced about  getting iphone 16 since I also have an ipad and I'm more into the ios system and \"looks\", even though before the xr (2019) I used an average samsung phone too.\n\n\nI'm a student and while commuting I use a bit of mobile data to scroll on social media for example. \nThus I'm looking for another second hand phone that will last me at least 4 years requirements being:\n\n-a nice battery that lasts a whole day or more (it's not difficult to top up my xr's one as of its state right now)\n\n-camera wise I have no need for fancy cameras as I think I wouldn't notice big differences cause I have no idea how it works besides de mp specs. Just want a camera that won't disappoint me if I want to take a photo of the moon, sunset, landcapes or people (that won't seem like it was heavily edited my the phones software cause I dislike how some Nokia phones do).\n\n\n-I feel like getting a S24 is better than getting iphone 16 specially for the 120hz, that I think changes my mind. In Europe it comes with Exynos but I read it might not be that big of a deal for me. \n\n-Lastly, I was drawn into the iphone's aesthetic but S24 has beautiful colors too that even if most likely I'll be slapping a case on it I bet it'll still look nice.\n\n\n\nI might be mistaken but I'm sure S24 or iphone 16 aren't particularly designed to run games at high refresh rates for 2/3 hours nonstop without overheating cause my xr used too. I just wonder if from the use I'll be giving it, which phone has the most potential keeping in mind the quality-price relation; its a shame from 128hbg to 256gb iphone 16 becomes so pricey, because otherwise I wouldn't mind the 60hz ;)\n\nAnd I don't care about the future Ai features that much, I'm fine without them and I can't think of them being useful on my daily tasks.",

Whenever I'm searching for a specific person's contact the phone just kind of hangs for a few seconds while typing where I get no response and then later whatever key I pressed just shows up all of a sudden. Happened only when I was searching contacts but just now it happened while searching whatsApp messages too which made me come here and ask around. What could be the issue? I'm on latest ios26, phone has been restarted too, no other apps were running in the background (not that it should affect anything). I'm just surprised why a latest phone is having any issues at all. I have a video of it too but not sure how to upload as this subreddit won't allow. ",

I’ve had this problem for 5+ years now, typically coming and going for months at a time depending in the iOS version and phone version. \n\nIt happens in various ways, eg. the alarm popping on the screen but not making any sound, or the alarm completely not happening at all and showing “off” in the Clock app despite 100% being on before the alarm time, or the alarm not happening at all and still showing “on” in the Clock app. \n\nThis happened to me very frequently in 2022, and started happening again after updating to iOS 17. Even more frequently now that I have an iPhone 17, approximately 20% of the time I would say. \n\nDoes anyone know what causes this? I’ve tried fixing all the Face ID settings, Attention settings, Focus settings, Sleep mode settings, Clock sound and silent vs. non-silent, redownloading the Clock app, multiple alarms. Nothing fixes it. I can set alarms at 7:00am, 7:10am, 7:20am then wake up at 8:00am on accident to see that *all of my alarms are still set to “on”, despite never going off!*\n\nI can’t believe this is still an issue, and I know I’m not alone too.

      "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/thingsapp/comments/1oib645/curious_about_your_experience_with_an_initial_sync/",
      "selftext": "Hi All\n\n**TL:DR** \\- my Initial sync is taking tens of minutes, what's your experience like? \n\nI've been using Things since v1.0, and as I discovered today, I've been using Things Cloud since 2012. So a long time user here. I'm also on the TestFlight. \n\nI was curious what people's experience of an initial sync was like? As it's new iPhone season, I'm sure a lot of us have just gone through that process. \n\nHere's my experience: \n\nI purchased a new iPhone 17 Pro Max when that came out, and that initial sync took maybe 25+ mins. I seem to recall this being the same sort of experience as last year. The day to day syncing of items is super speedy, so no problem there. I also decided to factory reset my MacBook Pro, and rather than restore from a backup, I set it up fresh. The initial sync there also took about 25 mins. \n\nI also decided to get a new Vision Pro, and when trying, and failing, to get the initial sync done, I reached out to Things support. Their experience using an obfuscated copy of my DB was that it took 10 mins and that I should be patient. After trying, and failing again, to get the AVP working I decided I'd delve into my Logbook and remove a bunch of entries, which is how I discovered my first one was from 2012. \n\nI exported all entries, and then went about deleting everything from 31st Dec 2024 backwards, so my Logbook only contained entries from 2025. That initial sync was faster, but still took 10 mins (on the M5 AVP and I decided to test on the 17 Pro Max - 10 mins on both). \n\nI was curious how large the Logbook was, from a plain text perspective. The logbook only extracts tasks titles, no notes or subtasks, no meta data (like tags, due dates etc), but my 13 year Logbook, when saved as plain text, was 326kb (kilobytes!). I was shocked to see how small that was given the 25 min + initial sync. My 2025 entries amount to about 36kb, and that took 10 mins. \n\nThings wasn't like this before. My suspicion is that this is due to the backend re-write they did. It's possible that as I'm using the TestFlight app there's something else at play here, but I've installed the App Store version and after giving it 5 mins to sync, I cancelled it and re-installed the TestFlight version. \n\nPart of the reason for posting is to find out if this is a one off for me, in which case I'll keep bugging support. Otherwise it might be that this big re-write is potentially not as smooth as it's been made out, and my concern would be the engineering cycles being burnt in attempting to resolve that vs deliver new features - or perhaps CC are happy to live with it, given how rarely it'll impact end users. \n\nUpdate: created a new Things Cloud account, synced my 2025 tasks to that. Logged out of my other devices and logged into the new account, that sync took maybe 5 seconds. So assuming there’s something up with my old account. I’ve let support know. ",

Most ng cases na napili ko so far is color blue to complement the deep blue iphone color.\n\nEto yung mga nabili ko so far and I would say best cases (so far):  \n**1. Apple TechWoven Case - Blue**  \ngreat grip pero wala syang protection sa camera plateau so you might want to buy a hydrogel protection . Eto yung best flex case so far tho ubusan ng color!  \nPrice : 3990Php\n\n**2. Spigen Liquid Air Navy Blue**  \nnot magsafe, goods pero may protection sa camera plateau, looks good sa phone and protects the camera plateau.  \nPrice: 1000\n\n**3. Ringke Fusion Magnetic Matte Clear**  \nwith camera protection - best clear case so far, daig pa yung official case ni Apple and yung mga case na binebenta sa powermac. hindi nagssmudge yung fingerprints masyado since mattle clear yung body  and nasshowcase nya yung natural beauty ng iphone since clear yung silicone sa camera side. Maganda yung magnets ng case na to. May freebie na paracord strap nung binili ko sa orange app.  \nPrice: 1159\n\n*in Transit*  \n**Caudabe Sheath Precise - Blue with Sand Buttons**  \nI think this is the best case wrt minimalistic design so far, hindi pa dumating yung sakin pero based sa caudabe forums, may mga buyers na nakareceive ng case na may \"rattling\" issue sa buttons since hindi totally fit yung buttons. FYI, buwan daw aantayin before mo to makuha.  \nPrice: Php 3600\n\n*To Consider:*  \n**Torras Ostand Q3 Air**  \nlooks good for those who want some spin stand for their phones, plus, magsafe.  \nPrice: Php \\~4000",

      "selftext": "I became an iPhone user last year. I've bought brand new, sealed iPhone SE 2022. I have 3 stories about iPhone batteries.\n\n1. I noticed that with every system update battery health dropped 1% point. 1 year and 2 months later I'm at 88% battery health and with noticeably shorter battery life. Worst thing was updating it to iOS 17.7. Before the update I had 6h SoT. Immediately after the update battery health dropped by 2% points and SoT fell to 4,5h tops. Screen on time never went back to 6h. Now it is around 3,5h to 4h. I also had a weird experience with iOS 17.4 which shortened SoT from 6h to 4h but it had fully recovered with iOS 17.6.\n2. At first I thought I was tripping and that my battery is just bad one which happens. But than interesting thing happened to my coworker. She has iPhone 12 which was on iOS 16.6, her battery life was by her words good and battery health was on 85% ( which is insane when you compare my iPhone and it's 88% after 1 year and hers is 4 years old ). Than last week she decided for some reason to update her phone to latest iOS 18.4.1 and her battery health dropped to 75% immediately after update. Few hours after update she received service warning telling her that battery needs replacement. She really got furious. The next day her phone started draining like crazy. She would charge it and it would discharge it self to 10-15% within 3-4 hours and 1,5h of SoT. And after 5 more days her battery has gotten swollen so much that screen started popping of. Maybe it is a coincidence but I don't trust Apple because they live from batteries that go bad after long time.\n3. My friend and his soon to be wife bot have iPhones. He has 11 pro and she has 12. Both experienced weird behavior with battery health and SoT. Every time they have updated their phone SoT and battery health would get lower. They have stopped automatic updates and they are on iOS 16.7.1 and since then in 2 years their battery health dropped by 1-2% and SoT stayed the same. We were talking about it several times, telling me that Apple is controlling battery health thru system updates and I didn't believe their stories until I heard my coworker's story.\n\nI'm sharing these stories in order to hear from other people around the world. Something has to be done about this. It ain't right. My Sony Xperia XZ Premium is 8 years old and it's SoT is consistently the same last 4 years ( around 4h) it doesn't have any problems. My brothers Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 has 0 problems with battery, lasts the same after 4 years of usage. I can see that people online are writing that their MacBook pros after 600-700 cycles later are still good and lasting enough. I would say that modern batteries are incredibly good and reliable but that is hurting Apple so they deliberately destroy them thru iOS.",

      "selftext": "I commented about this in the iphone battery thread as well but thought itd be worth checking multiple places just to be sure. \n\nSo over the last week my phones been losing battery whilst actively on charge,  at first i thought it was because i was running too many programs. So i shut all my programs and set the brightness aa low as possible  and that seemed to help but in the last few days its gotten significantly worse, i will have my phone only charges the lowest brightness possible and will only be running one app at a time, and my battery gets chewed through. \n\nAnd last night i left it to charge for a few hours, i had it on airplane mode with no tabs open on the lowest brightness. So nothing was running at all, and i woke up to it with 10% less charge than it had before, its getting insufferable because i cant figure out whats making it eat so much battery. \n\nI assumed possibly that my battery needed replacing or it was an issue with my charger- but for some reason my phone charges A-okay between the hours of 7am-10am. I had it plugged in this morning and was running upwards of 4 apps on it and it charged up yo 100% just fine, but now ive plugged it back in again to charge up and its lost 10% whilst charging and literally just typing this post.\n\nDies anyone know why it only takes the charger at an arbitrary time in the morning? This is really annoying and inconvenient and i wont always have the time to do this if I have morning shifts. \n\nEDIT- a comment pointed out that I missed some key details so:\n\nI’m on an Iphone 12 that I got in 2023, its running IOS 17 I believe and it has not had any issues before this. I use a generic Amazon charger, and it dies have a tab saying my battery health has decreased but the only solution it gives me is buying a new battery and I wanna see if theres anything else I can do first.

      "selftext": "Hi everyone,\nI’m looking for advice from anyone familiar with AFCA, Westpac’s fraud procedures, or banking escalation paths in Australia.\n\nHere’s what’s happened so far:\n\t•\t11 Oct 2025: Westpac locked my account after another person (who banks with ANZ) made a fraud report about a small transfer they sent me.\n\t•\t15 Oct 2025: The same thing happened again — my account was locked a second time, even though ANZ had already confirmed the fraud report was withdrawn.\n\t•\tWestpac now claims the same person re-reported the transaction, so they’ve kept my account frozen.\n\t•\tI moved my remaining funds to UBank, but Westpac apparently told UBank to freeze that money too, so both accounts are now locked.\n\t•\tI’ve since verified my ID with a JP, provided ANZ’s retraction proof, and lodged an AFCA complaint (Ref: 12-25-312909). AFCA contacted Westpac over a week ago, but Westpac keeps saying it’s “under investigation” with no timeframe.\n\nI’m under state ministerial care, so this means I have no access to any funds at all — no food, transport, or basic expenses for over two weeks.\nThe stress and financial impact have been extreme.\n\nI’ve already:\n\t•\tFiled a formal escalation letter with AFCA marked as urgent hardship\n\t•\tSent a formal demand to Westpac requiring action within 48 hours\n\t•\tKept all reference numbers and evidence (ANZ confirmation, call logs, etc.)\n\n⸻\n\n❓ What I’m asking for\n\t•\tHas anyone seen Westpac or UBank freeze both accounts like this before over a withdrawn fraud claim?\n\t•\tHow can I get AFCA to force Westpac to act faster?\n\t•\tShould I contact ASIC, DCJ (since I’m in state care), or a legal aid service next?\n\n⸻\n\nTL;DR\n\nWestpac froze my account on 11 and 15 Oct over a fraud claim that was withdrawn by ANZ. Then they got UBank to freeze my transferred funds too. I’m in state care with no access to money for over two weeks. AFCA is involved (Ref 12-25-312909) but progress is slow.\n\n⸻\n\nThis is all genuine — I have every reference number, call log, and document.\nAny advice or insight on how to escalate this urgently or what rights I have under AFCA’s hardship process would really help.\n\nThanks in advance\n\nAddition I forgot to include I did a job for $50 person lied and said it was a scam they retracted it and my account was unlocked I sent my savings (700) to ubank on the 13 of October my Westpac was locked again on the 15th. My ubank was locked for a week to the day I gave them my id with a jp and they said they are waiting for Westpac. \n\nIt’s disgusting how they don’t investigate they just lock and listen to somone trying to get my work and job off airtakser for free. I don’t know what to do I need that money as it’s all I have.\n\nI made an anz account with $0 as all my money is at ubank locked with Westpac.\n\n\nFor eveyone saying ai or my phone. 1. I got an iPhone 17 as it was the same with my phone contract. 2. It’s not ai i have an afca number look it up. 3. The money was I did a job an airtakser and they made a false report and then retracted it and then did it again\n\n\n\nI made a go fund me linked to my anz if anyone can send some money it will really help.  \n[go fund me](https://gofund.me/47fc0c148)",

I’ve read comments kasi saying na mas inuuna bigyan ng stocks ang malalaking malls especially sa Metro. That’s why I also never bothered to ask the PMC store kung kailan magkakaroon ng stocks. \n\nThankfully, it arrived before November! Maybe it also depends on the demand and population kung saan located yung branch before maaccommodate. Still, they shouldn’t have accepted pre-orders if they can’t accommodate it on the launch date :((\n\nFor reference, I ordered iPhone 17 Pro Silver 256 GB",

      "title": "Formal Complaint – Rogers Wireless Misrepresentation and Billing Without Delivery",
      "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Rogers/comments/1oi3gzo/formal_complaint_rogers_wireless/",
      "selftext": "On September 22, I visited a Rogers retail store to inquire about switching my mobile service from Bell to Rogers. After a detailed discussion with the in-store sales representative, I was presented with a compelling offer to switch providers, including a new iPhone 17 Pro Max (orange) and a Rogers SIM card. Based on that offer, I agreed to move forward.\n\nI was explicitly informed that both the new phone and the SIM card would be delivered to my home within 3–5 business days. The SIM card arrived four days later, but six weeks have now passed, and the phone has never been delivered. Despite that, I have now received an invoice for $232, even though the SIM card remains unused and still attached to its delivery card.\n\n\nUpon calling Rogers customer service, I was told there was “no record of a phone order”, which is simply implausible. It defies both logic and business practice that I would:\n\n\t1.\tSwitch carriers without receiving the promised device central to the offer, and\n\t2.\tActivate a SIM card or incur charges for a line tied to equipment I never received.\n\n\nToday the Roger’s customer service manager nullified the agreement entirely. But indicated I still owe the $232 for the first billing period and there will be charges yet to come next month for the shortened second bill.\n\nFrom a legal and consumer protection standpoint, Rogers is offside on several grounds:\n\n\t1.\tMisrepresentation and Failure of Consideration – The contract was induced by an explicit representation that a phone would be provided. Rogers has failed to deliver the primary consideration under that agreement, rendering the contract voidable and unenforceable in respect of any charges.\n\n\t2.\tUnjust Enrichment – Rogers is billing for services that cannot be rendered because the essential equipment was never delivered or activated. Accepting payment under such conditions constitutes unjust enrichment under Canadian common law principles.\n\n\t3.\tBreach of the CRTC Wireless Code – Section B1.1 of the Wireless Code mandates that carriers provide customers with a contract summary and ensure transparency in all offers. Rogers’ failure to accurately record or deliver the agreed-upon terms contravenes both the Wireless Code and Consumer Protection Acts (provincial statutes), which prohibit false, misleading, or incomplete representations.\n\n\t4.\tGood Faith and Fair Dealing – As a major Canadian telecommunications provider, Rogers owes a duty of good faith in both contract formation and performance. Failing to record or honour a signed in-store transaction and then billing the consumer for non-existent service breaches that duty.\n\nI am currently awaiting a response from the Office of the President to resolve this issue promptly. \n\nFor context, I am a business owner / executive who employs hundreds of people, and I was considering transitioning our entire corporate telecommunications structure from Bell to Rogers. \nThis experience has raised serious doubts about Rogers’ reliability and internal accountability.\n\nI will be respectfully requesting that Rogers:\n\t•\tReverse the $232 charge immediately,\n\t•\tInvestigate the sales transaction (including CCTV or system logs from the store on September 22), and\n\t•\tAS COMPENSATION - Deliver the originally promised device - now at no cost myself\n\nI trust that Rogers will act with the integrity and professionalism expected of a national carrier.",
